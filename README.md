# FishNetV3.CodeGenerator
Code generator for FishNet V3 that works outside of the unity editor. Not compatible with FishNet V4. Made specifically for modding Schedule I but probably works with anything that uses FishNet V3.

For now there is only a CLI tool but i'll be making a MSBuild extension next.

(Not optimized yet, but it runs good enough for now)
